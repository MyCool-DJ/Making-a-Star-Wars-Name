## It stops printing too early

ðŸ‘‰ Why is it printing 'Hell' instead of 'Hello'?


```python
myString = "Hello there my friend."
print(myString[0:4])
```

- The second argument should always be **one more** than the index of the final character.

```python
myString = "Hello there my friend."
print(myString[0:5])
```

## It won't stop printing the same character

ðŸ‘‰ What is the problem here?
```python
myString = "Hello there my friend."
print(myString[0:4:0])
```

The 0 in the third argument means 'move on 0 characters in the string each time'.  You've told it to print the same character again and again and again....

The third argument should be **at least 1**.
```python
myString = "Hello there my friend."
print(myString[0:4:1])
```
